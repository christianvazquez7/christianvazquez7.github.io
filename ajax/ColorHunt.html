	    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">ColorHunt is an Android game that promotes playing in the wild. The task of the game is to capture images that contain specific colors. Throughout the day, the colors you are asked to find change, and your score depends on how close your taken image is to the target color and how fast you find them! ColorHunt offers two core values to the player. First, it acts as a game that promotes exploration in the real world (think of it as a color scavenger hunt), as opposed to the inactivity promoted in games nowadays. Second, this playful system also affords the exploration of early color-blindness detection in children. Color Blindness is usually not detected until latter stages in a person’s life.  The ColorHunt game can make use machine-learning methodologies to detect patterns in captured colors and detect possible deficiencies early on, prompting a visit to the optometrist for more specialized testing.</div>
