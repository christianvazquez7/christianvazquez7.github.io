	    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Trailzz is an entrepreneurial venture aimed at developing a crowdsourced decision-making mobile application for Android and iOS that engages and helps users in the decision-making process.The average number of decisions made by a person is estimated to be as high as 35,000 per day, and over 200 of our everyday decisions are just about food. The sheer number of daily decisions, and the paradox of choice related to decision-making not only hamper the productivity of people, but also results in increased stress levels. Decision-making exhausts people physically and depletes cognitive resources, and thus, it is of essence to not overly employ our limited physical and mental energy for making trivial decisions. Trailzz alleviates the decision-making stress faced by people in their daily lives by making decision-making a social instead of an isolated process. By implementing a crowdsourced decision-making engine, we intend to provide fast and effective decisions based on choices provided by the user, with a high throughput of decisions per minute. Trailzz will not only free users from the pains and responsibilities of making decisions themselves, but also empower them by giving them a say in decisions happening around the globe. By supporting collective and participatory decision-making, Trailzz promotes an open and social decision-making process that allow users to tap into collective wisdom of the crowds.
